# SublimeText Bootsrap

I am a huge fan of automating stuff, and setting up my development environment is one of the things i aim at completely automating as i spent a great deal of time coding and switching between my text editor to my terminal.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a very powerful and popular editor/"ecosystem" with various tools for every code you’ll face. However, entering this ecosystem is long walk; setting up and learning all the plugins, tricks and such will take time.

This repo is inspired and forked from [evanplaice](https://github.com/evanplaice/sublime-text-seed) SublimeText seed. I have fixed few things that were not working on OSX and adding the part of automating setting up projects and workspaces.

Sublime Text configuration exists at those locations depended on your operating system:

 - **OSX**: `/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`
 - **Linux**: `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

Those configurations mainly consists of following:

 - `Packages/` folder where all your installed plugins and setting files lie (shortcut into this available through preferences menu)
 - `Packages/User/` folder where are the files specific to your configuration (other folders in Packages/ folder are pristine plugin files and should not be directly edited)
 - `Local/Session.sublime_session` stores all the information about projects, workspaces, etc.
 - `Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings` stores the preferences you have changed (main settings for Sublime Text)
 - `Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings` contains the list of installed addons

> If you have any custom packages, color schemes or themes then you can drop those in the `Packages/User/` folder

To batch install packages (plugins, themes, etc.), a `Package Control.sublime-settings` file needs to be placed into the `Packages/User/` folder. Inside of the settings file should be a JSON object with the key "installed_packages" that references a list of package names. When Package Control starts, if any of those packages are not present, the will be automatically downloaded and installed.

[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) is a package manager that makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep packages up-to-date. It is driven by the Command Palette. To open the palette, press ctrl+shift+p (Win, Linux) or cmd+shift+p (OS X). All Package Control commands begin with Package Control:, so start by typing Package.

# What is this ? tldr;

In short, this script aims at automatic installation + configuration of Sublime Text in OSX, Linux by:

 1. Installs `Sublime Text 3` with `apt-get` or `brew`
 2. Installs `Package Control`
 3. Instals your desired theme that you backup in the `./themes` folder
 4. Load your default configurations that you have in `./user-settings`
 5. Configure projects (either single or multiple projects at a time)

The setup script works transparently across all platforms by leveraging python as well as OS-specific package managers

> Note: I have not tested personally the installation script on Linux, but would love any input there

# Usage

Run the following to install and config `Sublime Text`

```bash
./setup.py
```

Restart the editor when prompted to do so. To view the package installation progress open the `Sublime Text` console.

> **Note**: This WILL overwrite the existing configuration if you have answered `y` when prompted to overwrite current configurations

# Configuration

A default configuration is included with this package. Feel free to fork the project and add your own custom configuration.

### General Settings

*User-Settings*
```json
{
	"highlight_modified_tabs": true,
	"tab_size": 2,
	"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
	"draw_white_space": "all",
	"indent_guide_options":
	[
		"draw_normal",
		"draw_active"
	],
}
....
```

### Key bindings

I have customized various shortcuts and overriden few detaults. These key bindings are saved in `Default (OSX).sublime-keymap` in `Packages/User/` folder. For me, i have changed the default Find and Replace to be `command+h`.

```json
[
	{ "keys": ["option+a"], "command": "alignment" },
	{ "keys": ["super+h"], "command": "show_panel", "args": {"panel": "find_in_files"} }
]
```

### Themes

I use [material-theme](https://packagecontrol.io/Package%20Control.sublime-package)

*User-Settings*
```json
{
	"theme": "Material-Theme-Darker.sublime-theme",
	"color_scheme": "Packages/User/cobalt/MaterialCobalt.tmTheme",
}
```
I also include various theme specific setting in `Preferences.sublime-settings` like:

```json
	"material_theme_accent_lime": true,
	"material_theme_accent_orange": true,
	"material_theme_accent_purple": true,
	"material_theme_accent_red": true,
	"material_theme_accent_yellow": true,
	"material_theme_arrow_folders": true,
	"material_theme_big_fileicons": true,
	"material_theme_bold_tab": true
	...
```

As for the color scheme, i have customized an existing color scheme and have that in `user-setting/cobalt` folder. In the configuration process. this fill will be copied to ``Packages/User/cobalt` and will be loaded by the line `"color_scheme": "Packages/User/cobalt/MaterialCobalt.tmTheme"`

# Project Setup

Projects in Sublime Text are made up of two files: the `.sublime-project` file, which contains the project definition, and the `.sublime-workspace` file, which contains user specific data, such as the open files and the modifications to each. To understand more about projects, you can refer to [this page](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/projects.html).

> As a general rule, the `.sublime-project` file can be checked into version control, while the `.sublime-workspace` file would not

A daunting task for me is when i clone a bunch of repos that i would likk to work on (especially if you are dealing with Microservices where you can have tens of repos) and i need to set up a Sublime Text project for each of those folders. After a bit of investigation, i found out that i can actually automate this process by creating the files needed by Sublime Text.

Basically, the script creates `.sublime-project` at the root of each folder initalized with the following:

```json
{
	"folders":
	[
		{
			"path": "/PATH/TO/FOLDER"
		}
	]
}
```
The script also creates a `.sublime-workspace` folder intialized with an empty JSON object `{}` that Sublime will fill up with additional metadata after.

The last step is tell Sublime where these files so that they can come up in the projects drop down. To do that, we need to add the paths for the `.sublime-workspace` to `Local/Session.sublime_session` inside of the `workspaces.recent_workspaces` array
